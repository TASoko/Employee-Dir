## Installation
### This app has been deployed on Heroku therefore can be opened using the deployed link. When cloning the repos to your computer run npm install then npm start. The app will run locally on port 3000.

## Usage
### Keeping track of employees can be hard so this app helps an employer do just that. When the app is opened the user can see a list of 50 employees with their first and last name, their location (city and country), their email address and phone numbers. If a user were to click on the Last Name title of the column the table will sort itself alphabetically by last name in descending order. If clicked again it will resort itself alphabetically in ascending order. There is an input field that allows the user to filter through the table for a name or country.
